Edge Detection App :

My Edge Detection App is a Python-based desktop application built using Tkinter and OpenCV.
It allows users to upload an image, apply different edge detection algorithms, and adjust their parameters dynamically in real time.
The app displays both the input and output images side by side for better visualization and comparison.

Features :
Multiple Edge Detection Algorithms :-
Supports Canny, Sobel, and Laplacian edge detection.
Real-Time Parameter Adjustment :-
Modify algorithm parameters using sliders and see the changes instantly.
Dual Image Display :-
Shows both input and output images simultaneously for easy comparison.
Dark Themed User Interface :-
Clean and modern interface built with Tkinter using a dark grey color scheme.
Modular Code Design :-
Structured into separate modules for better maintainability and scalability.


Installation:
